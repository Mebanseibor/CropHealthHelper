### Title:
- Farmers Disease Diagnostic/Reporting Portal - Mobile Portal Al Based
### Description:
- Background - Agricultural productivity and food security are heavily dependent on the health of crops and livestock.
- Farmers, especially in remote or resource-limited areas, often face challenges in diagnosing and reporting diseases that affect their livestock and crops.
- Early diagnosis and timely reporting are crucial for effective disease management and prevention of widespread outbreaks.
- Description - A mobile portal powered by Artificial Intelligence (Al) for disease diagnosis and reporting can revolutionize how farmers manage animal and plant health.
- This portal enables farmers to use their smartphones to access diagnostic tools, report symptoms, and receive actionable advice.
- AI algorithms can analyze reported data to provide accurate diagnoses and suggest appropriate treatments or interventions.
- This technology can empower farmers with the knowledge and tools to manage diseases more effectively, ensuring the health and productivity of their farms.
- Integrate Al-based software with existing NDLM to allow farmers to submit images and descriptions of disease signs and symptoms.
- The Al will generate suspected disease/condition reports with preventive measures and send alerts to veterinarians for appropriate action (Al-based software, Mobile application).
- Expected Outcomes:
    - Enhanced Disease Diagnosis
    - Timely Reporting and intervention
    - Increased Access to Expert Knowledge
    - Improved Farm Productivity.
    - Data Collection and Analysis
    - Cost-Effective DiseaseManagement
    - Empowerment and Education of Farmers
    - Integration with Existing Surveillance Systems.
    - Community Engagement and Support
    - Sustainable Agriculture Practices
